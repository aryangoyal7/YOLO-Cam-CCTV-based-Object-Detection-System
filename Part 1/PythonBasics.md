# Week 1
## Introduction to basics of Python

Welcome to the YOLO Object Detection project! We are thrilled to have you onboard as a mentee. This project is all about building your skills in computer vision and object detection using YOLO v8 tech. To get started, we suggest you brush up your Python basics.

We recommend two online resources for learning the basics of Python:

Corey Schafer's Python Tutorial: These detailed and comprehensive videos cover all the basics of Python. We suggest watching videos 1-11, 15, and 19 before starting the second week's material. You can access the playlist  [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7).

Or,

Programming with Mosh: This video provides a complete guide to the basics of Python and is a one-stop-shop for learning. You can access it [here](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc).

We encourage you to take some time to go through these resources and familiarize yourself with Python basics before diving into the YOLO Object Detection project. This will make your journey smoother and more enjoyable.

In the meantime, please take a look at the project repository and familiarize yourself with the codebase. We will be sharing more details about the project and your specific tasks soon.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on the project channel.

We are excited to have you onboard and look forward to seeing your progress!
