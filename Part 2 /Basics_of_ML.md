# Week 2 - Basics of ML and Object detection

We are done with learning python, now we'll move to learning machine learning and specifically object detection in it.

We'll start from the very basics from defination of what is machine learning to implementing object detecting using pytorch libraries.

You'll refer the following resources and learn the mentioned topics against it.

 - You can use this [IIT Madras course](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~miteshk/CS7015_2018.html) CS 7015 , it's a very indept and long course you may study till lecture 5 then lecture 11 and 12.
 This course is a bit maths heavy which is also the true escense of Machine learning otherwise you are just working with black boxes.
 But you might wanna skip some topics for now at your own discretion.
 There is extra reading material mentioned as well against lectures explore that as well.

 - If you dont feel comfortable you might try watching Andrew Ng's Machine learning basics course and Deep learning specialization series instead that is  easier to begin with.
