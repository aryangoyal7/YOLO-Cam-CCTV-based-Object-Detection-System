# Homework 1


 You have make a regression model using pytorch library and report the accuracy of your results in form of graphs like iteration vs accuracy.
You also have to find the data yourself on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), we are not spoon feeding the dataset because it is one of the most important aspects of solving a ML problems is finding good data source , learn how to pick a good dataset and choose one for yourself.

Make sure you do the following steps:


- Download and explore the dataset
-  Prepare the dataset for training
- Create a linear regression model
- Train the model to fit the data
- Make predictions using the trained model
