# PyTorch tutorial

In the last phase of the project, you not only learned the fundamentals of machine learning but also delved into advanced concepts such as CNN and object detection.

Now, we will proceed with writing Python code in this phase. However, using Python alone without any machine learning library can be quite challenging. To experience and understand the difficulty, try implementing a 3-4 layer neural network from scratch, including activation functions and loss functions.

Fortunately, we have some helpful libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras to assist us. These frameworks simplify the coding process, making it more manageable and efficient.

For our purposes, we will be using PyTorch.

To facilitate your learning of this user-friendly library, I will provide a list of resources. Afterwards, you will be given various ML models to work on, allowing you to gain hands-on experience with both the library and machine learning in general.

Remember, simply having theoretical knowledge without implementing and addressing the challenges of model optimization and training based on real data is merely an illusion of understanding machine learning.

- [Pytorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html) is pretty easy to read and understand, do go thru it once atleast and keep refering it in case of doubts.

- If you prefer watching youtube videos, here is [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrcDBWF5mfPGpqQDSta6VK4). Make sure you dont just watch it but implement the same as well.
